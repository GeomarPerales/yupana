Description: This R package provides a set of tools for analyzing extreme precipitation
 events based on daily maximum precipitation records. It includes functions for fitting
 probability distributions (e.g., Normal, Gumbel, Log-Normal), estimating return periods,
 and visualizing extreme value behavior. The package is designed to support hydrological
 and climatological studies, infrastructure design, and risk assessment related to intense rainfall events.
